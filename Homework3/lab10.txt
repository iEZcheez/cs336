Compare and contrast MongoDB and the SQL databases you’ve used before. Are there things that one can do that the other can’t?
- Mongo has object oriented data while SQL has data that can be parsed
- SQL can do join on data
- Mongo can use JSON data

You could run MongoDB locally. What advantages and/or disadvantages would that bring with respect to the cloud database you have now?
- Cloud databases could die
- Local databases are stored permanantly on one machine but it depends on how you use the database

You’ve built a “sandbox” database on mLab. Could you use this for a production database? Why or why not?
- It is a sandbox and the website says that it should be used for experimentation
- It is not for professional use

When everything is running again, consider the following questions.

For this integration of mLab into your application, was it better to run the modified server (npm start) or the full Webpack development environment (npm run dev)? Why?
- The webpack appears to use less data in the network which is good

Explain what happens when you modify the database using mLab’s web interface rather than your application? Try adding/updating/deleting comment documents.
- The information updates in the client side as well

Is this comments application the sort of application that should use an SQL or a noSQL database? Explain your answer.
- The app simply displays comments and the data do not really have relationships
- MongoDB is NoSQL which is good for that purpose and it is also faster than SQL
