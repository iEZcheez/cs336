Explain:

the component structure of the application. What makes the UI composable and why does this matter?
what JSX does.
why ReactJS is safe with respect to XSS.
how the data flows through the components. How are comments loaded? created? saved.
the nature and purpose of props and state. Which is immutable and which is mutable and why does this distinction matter?
Consider the following, more detailed questions based on statements in the tutorial.

Try editing the comments.json file (to add or remove a legal comment). What happens and why?
When the CommentBox has loaded comments from the server (in loadCommentsFromServer()), why doesn’t it call render() to make them visible?
Of what advantage, if any, is it to require that components always represent the current state of the view?
The app implements optimistic updates. Isn’t optimism here more like foolishness? What if the server rejects the new comment (for whatever reason)?
