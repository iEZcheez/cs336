Vision statement:
I currently do not have any specific project ideas, but I am interested in making an application that deals with using online data. It could be a website that extracts data from bird migration and then the user can use certain tools to analyze or look at visuals. 
I would also be interested in a website that updates from a database periodically, and users that access the website can interact on the page and other users can see the live interactions. Maybe a chat room with visuals or interactive elements that users can communicate each other with.
I am also interested in a website where a user can create a personal profile and they would be placed on a global leaderboard where there is a game on the SPA. The game could be a clicking game like Cookie Clicker, or an interactive grid that allows users to dominate the grid by clicking on grids to claim the grid.
I would be okay with working with a Software Engineering project conversion into an SPA.
