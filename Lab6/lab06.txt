exercise 1
1.
Identify the request methods that you can and can’t test using the two tools listed above.
If a method cannot be testing using a particular tool, explain why this is the case.
List the Curl commands you used successfully.
I used all of the types of requests and they have worked such as HEAD, PUT, POST, and the other ones.

2.
What is the most appropriate HTTP response code for pages that aren’t defined by an Express route?
I used code 502, which gives "Service Unavailable". Although, code 404 could be an option as well.

exercise 2
1.
What HTTP methods do forms support?

2.
How is the form data being passed back to the server and what syntactic form does it take?
Is the data modified in any way?

Notes:
GET
The GET method requests a representation of the specified resource. Requests using GET should only retrieve data.
HEAD
The HEAD method asks for a response identical to that of a GET request, but without the response body.
POST
The POST method is used to submit an entity to the specified resource, often causing a change in state or side effects on the server.
PUT
The PUT method replaces all current representations of the target resource with the request payload.
DELETE
The DELETE method deletes the specified resource.
